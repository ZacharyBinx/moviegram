## Description

Moviegram allows all who login to add films they have seen or want to see to the list! You can use a simple rating system and bookmark movies to watch later!

## Usage

This allows communities to share movies in a more local way that is fine tuned to the communities tastes. Don't be dissuaded from a movie due to popular opinion. Use the opinions of friends and family with this site!
